If you see some JSON everything is working as expected.\n\n## Deploy on Google App Engine\n\nCreate a app.yaml file containing the lines below in the ResistorColoursApi folder. \n\n~~~\nruntime: aspnetcore\nenv: flex\n~~~\n\nAdd the yaml file to the api project by updating ResistorColorsApi.csproj:\n~~~\n<Project ...>\n...\n<ItemGroup> \n    <None Include=\\\"app.yaml\\\" CopyToOutputDirectory=\\\"PreserveNewest\\\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n...\n</Project>\n~~~\n\nPublish the solution:\n~~~\ndotnet publish -c Release\n~~~\n\nCreate and deploy the solution to Google App Engine:\n~~~\ngcloud projects create resistor-bands\ngcloud config set project resistor-bands\ngcloud app create\ngcloud app deploy .\\\\bin\\elease\\\\netcoreapp2.1\\\\publish\\\\app.yaml\ngcloud app browse\n~~~\n\n## Delete the project from Google App Engine\n\nHaving an app running on Google App Engine costs a few dollars per month so you may want to delete it before get charged this can be done with the command below:\n\n~~~\ngcloud projects delete resistor-bands\n~~~\",\"snippet\":\"Let's build a web api to iterpret resistor colour bands in ASP.NET Core"}}
